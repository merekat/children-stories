ChildGPT is an innovative application that creates custom children's stories based on input parameters such as age and other preferences. What sets this app apart is its ability to narrate these stories using an AI-generated voice that mimics a parent or loved one, trained on their voice samples. Additionally, the app generates captivating images to accompany each story, providing a unique and engaging experience for children.

The app runs as a web interface where you can customize your story settings. Hitting the "Generate Story" button will create you a story, a cover picture and corresponding audio files that read the story to the user. You can find already existing stories in the "Explore" section. An already existing story can be set to music with a different voice. It is also possible to add your own voice to the existing speaker list. 

## Features

- **Custom Story Generation**: Stories tailored to the child's age and preferences.
- **AI Voice Synthesis**: Narrates stories using a familiar voice (e.g., parent's voice).
- **Image Generation**: Automatically creates illustrations to accompany the stories.
- **Interactive Experience**: Engaging storytelling for children, even when parents can't be there in person.
