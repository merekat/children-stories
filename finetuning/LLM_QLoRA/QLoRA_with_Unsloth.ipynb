He ran and ran, but the moon was always just out of reach. He climbed up a tree, but the moon was higher. He jumped over a stream, but the moon was farther away. He even dug a tunnel, but the moon was beyond it. At last, he realized that the moon was not a thing to be caught. It was just a beautiful sight to see. The little rabbit returned home, happy to have seen the lovely moon.<|eot_id|>\n"
